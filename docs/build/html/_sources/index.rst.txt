 
Energy Differential Privacy (EDP)
======================================

Energy Differential Privacy (EDP) enables the use of the gold standard of privacy protection, differential privacy, for high value energy efficiency analytics.

This project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the `Energy Data Vault <https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/energy-data-vault>`_ project.

This documentation covers the core library (`eeprivacy`) as well as detailed examples of applying the library in practice.

In contrast to other open source differential privacy projects, EDP focuses on enabling and optimizing sector-specific use cases, rather than serving as a general-purpose analytics tool. In our experience, private algorithm design is highly sensitive to the details of use cases, making it difficult to achieve usable accuracy at reasonable privacy budgets using a general-purpose approach.
